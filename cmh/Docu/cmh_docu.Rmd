# Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel Test - Background

The CMH procedure tests for conditional independence in partial contingency tables (usually) for a 2x2xK design. However, it can be generalized to IxJxK tables (Agresti). 

Depending on the `scale`  of the variables, the number of degrees of freedom differs: 

- `general association` statistic (X and Y are treated as nominal) results in `(X-1) * (Y-1) dfs`
- `row mean` scores statistic (X is nominal and Y is ordinal) results in `X-1 dfs`
- `nonzero correlation` statistic (X and Y ordinal) results in `1 df`

To be consistent between SAS and R, the following naming conventions are used when referring to variables below: 

X = exposure 

Y = response 

K = control 


# Testing Schemata

In order to follow a systematic approach and to cover the 2x2xK as well as the generalized CMH test multiple data schemata were tested. Also, some edge cases with sparse data were used. From the original 10 schemata, we selected four which demonstrate the main issues: 

| Number  | Schema |  Variables | Relevant Test | Description |   
|---|---|---|---|---|
|  1 | 2x2x2   | X = TRTP, Y = SEX, K = AGEGR1  | General Association | TRTP and AGEGR1 were limited to two categories, overall the the groups were rather balanced |   
|   3| 2x2x3  | X = TRTP, Y = SEX, K = RACE  |  General Association |   Gives back NaN in R because RACE is very imbalanced|
|   6| 2x5x2  | X = TRTP, Y = AVAL, K = SEX  |  Row Means |   Compare Row Means results for R and SAS|
|   9|  3x5x17 |X = TRTP, Y = AVAL, K = SITEID   | Row Means   | SITEID has many strata and provokes sparse groups, AVAL is ordinal, therefore row means statistic applies here  | 
| 10 | 5x3x3  | X = AVAL, Y = AGEGR1, K = TRTP |  Correlation | X and Y are ordinal variables and therefore the correlation statistics has to be taken here |

# Implementation

## Data 

For the further documentation the CDSIC data were used and pre-processed: 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
### pre-filtering data 
haven::read_xpt("https://github.com/phuse-org/TestDataFactory/raw/main/Updated/TDF_ADaM/adcibc.xpt") %>% 
  filter(EFFFL == 'Y' & ITTFL == 'Y', AVISITN == 8 & ANL01FL=='Y') 

```


## In SAS 

The cmh test is calculated in SAS using the PROC FREQ procedure. By default, it outputs the chi square statistic, degrees of freedom and p-value for each of the three alternative hypothesis: `general association`, `row means differ`, and `nonzero correlation`.

When the design of the contingency table is 2x2xK (i.e, X == 2 levels, Y == 2 levels, K >= 2 levels), the Mantel-Haenszel Common Odds Ratio (odds ratio estimate, 95% CI, P-value) and the Breslow-Day Test for Homogeneity of the Odds Ratios (chi-square statistic, degrees of freedom, P-value) are also output.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
Proc freq data = filtered_data; 
tables K * X * Y / cmh; 
run; 

```


## In R 

We did not find any R package that delivers all the same measures as SAS at once. Therefore, we tried out multiple packages: 
```{r, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(magrittr)
library(reactable)
yes <- "\U2705"
no <- "\U274C"
tibble::tribble(
  ~Package, ~`General Association`, ~`Row Means Differ`, ~`Nonzero Correlation`, ~`M-H Odds Ratio`, ~`Homogeneity Test`, ~Note,
 "stats::mantelhaen.test()", yes, no, no, yes, no, "Works well for 2x2xK",
 "vcdExtra::CMHtest()", yes,yes,yes,no,no,"Problems with sparsity, potential bug",
 "epiDisplay::mhor()", no,no,no,yes,yes,"Note"
) %>%
  reactable::reactable(fullWidth = TRUE,defaultColDef = colDef(html = TRUE, align = "center"), columns = list(Note = colDef(width = 120), Package = colDef(width = 170)))
```


### mantelhaen.test()

This is included in a base installation of R, as part of the stats package. Requires inputting data as a *table*.

```{r, eval = F}
mantelhaen.test(x = data$x, y = data$y, z = data$k)
```


### CMHtest()

The vcdExtra package provides results for the generalized CMH test, for each of the three model it outputs the Chi-square value and the respective p-values. Flexible data input methods available: *table* or *formula* (aggregated level data in a data frame).

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(vcdExtra)
CMHtest(Freq~X+Y|K,data=filtered_data, overall=TRUE) 
```

#### Forked Version - Solution for sparse data

To tackle the [issue with sparse data](https://github.com/friendly/vcdExtra/issues/3) it is recommended that a use of `solve()` is replaced with `MASS::ginv`. This was implemented in the forked version of vcdExtra which can be installed from here: 
```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("mstackhouse/vcdExtra")
```

However, also the forked version for the vcdExtra package works only until a certain level of sparsity. In case of our data, it still works if the data are stratified by the pooled Site ID (SITEGR1 - 11 unique values) whereas using the unpooled Site ID (SITEID - 17 unique values) also throws an error. 


#### Bug 

Exploring the vcdExtra package in detail we realized that there seems to be a bug in the implementation which we would like to highlight here.

Using an independent data example (3x2x2), we first ran the CMH test through SAS and obtained the following:

```{r}
# Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel Statistics (Based on Table Scores)
# Statistic    Alternative Hypothesis    DF       Value      Prob
# ---------------------------------------------------------------
#   1        Nonzero Correlation        1      6.4586    0.0110
#   2        Row Mean Scores Differ     2     26.0278    <.0001
#   3        General Association        2     26.0278    <.0001
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
test_eg <- data.frame(x = c('low','low','low','low','med','med','med','med', 'high','high','high','high'),
                      k = c('yes','yes','no','no', 'yes','yes','no','no','yes','yes','no','no'),
                      y = c('yes','no', 'yes','no','yes','no','yes','no','yes','no','yes','no'),
                      Freq = c(11,43,42,169,14,104,20,132,8,196,2,59))

library(vcdExtra)
```

When we specify the analysis in R this way, we get the following results:
```{r}
CMHtest(Freq~x+y|k, data=test_eg, overall=TRUE, details=TRUE)$ALL$table
```

By default, all 3 tests (and a 4th) are output. The results seem to match.

When we specify the analysis using an explicit *type* argument, we get the following results:
```{r}
CMHtest(Freq~x+y|k, data=test_eg, overall=TRUE, details=TRUE, type = "ALL")$ALL$table
```

While we've essentially asked for everything (i.e. the default), albiet explicitly, the results do not match. The degrees of freedom seem to be mismatched with results in wrong p-values (if we assume SAS is the gold standard)


Similarly, if we specify we would *only* like certain tests returned, the results seem dependent on the order of specification:

```{r}
# Order: cor, general, rmeans
CMHtest(Freq~x+y|k, data=test_eg, overall=TRUE, details=TRUE, types=c("cor","general","rmeans"))$ALL$table
```

```{r}
# Order: rmeans, general, cor
CMHtest(Freq~x+y|k, data=test_eg, overall=TRUE, details=TRUE, types=c("rmeans","general","cor"))$ALL$table
```

Impact: In the event of a 2x2xK design, all 3 test statistics, degrees of freedom and p-values are the same. Therefore, specifying a 2x2xK analysis any of the ways above results in correct "answer", though they are technically mixed up. 

This is why we chose as a 3x2x2, so we can clearly where things are mixed up. 

We are planning to submit an issue to the vcdExtra github for the author's review.

### Epi Display package 

To get the M-H common odds ratio and the homogeneity test, the epiDisplay package can be used. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(epiDisplay) 
mhor(x,y,k, graph = FALSE)
```


# Results

Here the results can be seen: 

## CMH Statistics 
```{r, echo = F, warning = FALSE}
readRDS(here::here('cmh/Docu/interim_update','table1b.RDS'))
```
  
  
As it can be seen, there are two schemata where R does not provide any results:

```{r, echo = F}
readRDS(here::here('cmh/Docu/interim_update','table1a.RDS'))
```

Reason for NaN in schema 3: Stratum k = AMERICAN INDIAN OR ALASKA NATIVE can not be compared because there are only values for one treatment and one gender.  
Reason for Error 4: 
> For large sparse table (many strata) CMHTest will occasionally throw a Error in solve.default(AVA) because of singularity



## Odds Ratio
Only applicable to 2x2xK designs.
```{r, echo = F}
readRDS(here::here('cmh/Docu/interim_update','table2.RDS'))
```

## Homogenity Test
Only applicable to 2x2xK designs.
```{r, echo = F}
readRDS(here::here('cmh/Docu/interim_update','table3.RDS'))
```
We can see for cases where ... R and SAS deliver almost the same output. However, if xxx there appear differences.
